## 💻 Project

The Ignite Shop 🛒 is an exciting project developed as part of Rocketseat's Ignite program. The main goal is to integrate the application with the Stripe API, creating a dynamic shopping experience.

In this project, users can browse, select, and purchase stylish t-shirts 👕 while exploring a modern and functional interface. The development of Ignite Shop incorporates several cutting-edge technologies, such as Next.js for server-side rendering, Stripe for payment processing, and Stitches for styling, among others.

Throughout the process, key concepts like component composition, state management with Context API, and API integration with axios are applied. This ensures a robust and scalable solution while providing an engaging user experience.

Ignite Shop showcases the power of combining modern technologies to build an efficient, elegant, and user-focused e-commerce platform.
